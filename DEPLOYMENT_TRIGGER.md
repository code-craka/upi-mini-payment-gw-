# Force Deployment Trigger

This file is created to trigger a fresh Vercel deployment.

**Current Issue**: Backend deployment stuck on old commit from September 22nd
**Solution**: Push new commit to main branch to trigger fresh build

**Deployment Status**: 
- Last Backend Deployment: September 22, 2025 (commit 1634789)
- Current Fix: October 4, 2025 (commit b3ea930)

**Changes Made**:
1. Fixed backend vercel.json to use `dist/server.js` after TypeScript compilation
2. Removed hardcoded environment variables from vercel.json
3. Added proper build configuration

**Environment Variables Required in Vercel Dashboard**:

Backend:
- MONGO_URI
- JWT_SECRET 
- APP_BASE_URL
- API_BASE_URL
- SENTRY_DSN

Frontend:
- VITE_API_URL
- VITE_FRONTEND_URL
- VITE_SENTRY_DSN
- VITE_APP_VERSION

**Next Steps**:
1. Monitor Vercel deployment logs
2. Test login functionality after deployment
3. Verify environment variables are properly set in Vercel dashboard
