# UPI Mini Gateway v2.0 RBAC Frontend Testing Checklist

**Testing Date**: September 23, 2024
**Backend Version**: v2.0 (3-Role Hierarchy)
**Frontend Testing**: Local Development Environment

---

## üéØ Testing Overview

This checklist ensures the frontend UI properly handles the new 3-role hierarchy system:

- **superadmin** (was admin) - Global access
- **merchant** - Manages their users
- **user** - Self-management only

---

## üîß Setup for Testing

### **Backend Setup** ‚úÖ

- [x] v2.0 backend running on `http://localhost:3000`
- [x] Frontend configured to use `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000`
- [x] Database connected with v2.0 RBAC schema

### **Test User Accounts Needed**

Create these test accounts for comprehensive testing:

```bash
# 1. Superadmin account (use existing admin or create new)
username: test_superadmin
password: test123
role: superadmin

# 2. Merchant account (to be created by superadmin)
username: test_merchant
password: test123
role: merchant

# 3. User account (to be created by merchant)
username: test_user
password: test123
role: user
parent: test_merchant
```

## üêõ Known Potential Issues to Check

### **Frontend Code Changes Needed**

Check if frontend expects these old vs new patterns:

1. **Role References**:
   ```javascript
   // OLD: role === "admin"
   // NEW: role === "superadmin"
   ```

2. **User Creation Response**:
   ```javascript
   // NEW fields to handle: parent, createdBy, createdAt
   ```

3. **Order Object Structure**:
   ```javascript
   // NEW fields: merchant, createdBy, invalidatedBy, metadata
   ```

### **API Response Changes**

- User list now includes parent field
- Order list includes merchant references
- Dashboard stats are role-filtered
